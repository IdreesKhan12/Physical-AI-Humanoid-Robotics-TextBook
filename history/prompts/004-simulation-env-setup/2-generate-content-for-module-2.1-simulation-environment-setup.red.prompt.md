## Prompt

yes

## Response snapshot

I have generated the content for Chapter 2.1: Simulation Environment Setup, and marked the content writing tasks (T015-T019) as conceptually completed for this chapter.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated content for Module 2, Chapter 2.1 and marked associated tasks as complete.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: docs/module-2/gazebo-setup.mdx
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with content generation for Chapter 2.2 or next Module.
- 🧠 Reflection: The iterative content generation process is working as expected.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
