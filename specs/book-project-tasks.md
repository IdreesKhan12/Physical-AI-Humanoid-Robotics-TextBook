# Tasks: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Creation

**Input**: Project plan from specs/book-project-plan.md

## Phase 1: Foundation (Setup and Initial Configuration)

- [X] T001 Create Docusaurus project.
- [X] T002 Configure Docusaurus `docusaurus.config.js`.
- [X] T003 Set up initial folder structure for modules (`/docs/module-1`, etc.).
- [X] T004 Set up GitHub repository and GitHub Pages deployment.
- [X] T005 Configure continuous writing workflow via Claude Code & Gemini CLI.

## Phase 2: Project-Level Research

- [X] T006 Familiarize with ROS 2 Official Docs.
- [X] T007 Familiarize with Gazebo Documentation.
- [X] T008 Familiarize with Unity Robotics Hub.
- [X] T009 Familiarize with NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2 Docs.
- [X] T010 Gather academic papers on embodied intelligence.
- [X] T011 Gather robotics textbooks on kinematics/perception.

## Phase 3: Iterative Module/Chapter Development

- [X] T012 For Module X: Identify required research topics (e.g., ROS architecture, sensors, etc.).
- [X] T013 For Module X: Validate technical points against primary sources.
- [X] T014 For Module X: Outline sub-sections for each chapter.
- [X] T015 For Module X, Chapter X.Y: Write content (Introduction, Objectives, Explanations, Diagrams, etc.).
- [X] T016 For Module X, Chapter X.Y: Validate content against quality checks.
- [X] T017 For Module X, Chapter X.Y: Insert APA citations.
- [X] T018 For Module X, Chapter X.Y: Render Docusaurus preview.
- [X] T019 For Module X, Chapter X.Y: Commit changes to GitHub.

## Phase 4: Overall Quality & Deployment

- [X] T020 Run full Docusaurus build check (`npm run start`).
- [ ] T021 Verify GitHub Pages deployment builds successfully. (BLOCKED - Docusaurus build error from T020)
- [ ] T022 Conduct final content acceptance tests (answer module outcomes, match structure, readable diagrams, summaries).
- [ ] T023 Conduct final spec compliance tests (constitution rules, specify requirements, APA, word count).
