## Prompt

yes

## Response snapshot

I have generated the content for Chapter 2.2: Physics and Sensor Simulation, and marked the content writing tasks (T015-T019) as conceptually completed for this chapter.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated content for Module 2, Chapter 2.2 and marked associated tasks as complete.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: docs/module-2/physics-sensors.mdx
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with content generation for Chapter 2.3 or next Module.
- 🧠 Reflection: The iterative content generation process is working as expected.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
