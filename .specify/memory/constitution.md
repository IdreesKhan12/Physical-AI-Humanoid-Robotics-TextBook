# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation: A Guide to Building Documentation with Docusaurus and Spec-Kit Plus Constitution

## Core Principles

### Utility
The book must serve as a practical, actionable guide for readers.

### Clarity & Accessibility
Content must be easy to understand for developers and technical writers.

### Spec-Driven Consistency
Strict adherence to all defined specifications, including spec-kit-plus conventions and Docusaurus structure.

### Reproducibility
All code examples and setup steps must be fully functional and verifiable by the reader.

## Key Standards

- **Target Audience:** Developers, Technical Writers, and AI/Prompt Engineers interested in structured documentation.
- **Book Structure:** Must align with the standard Docusaurus sidebar configuration (e.g., sections for "Introduction," "Setup," "Spec-Kit Plus Deep Dive," "Deployment").
- **Code Quality:** All code snippets must be syntactically correct, commented, and adhere to modern best practices.
- **Tone:** Instructional, encouraging, and technically precise.
- **Writing Clarity:** Focus on direct, concise instructions and explanations.

## Constraints

- **Platform:** Output must be formatted for **Docusaurus markdown/MDX**.
- **Source Code Generation:** All chapters and associated files must be primarily generated via **AI Code Generation** and managed using the **Spec-Kit Plus** methodology.
- **Deployment Target:** Must include clear, tested steps for deployment to **GitHub Pages**.
- **Minimum Content:** Must cover installation, basic usage, specification-driven content creation, and deployment.

## Governance

- **Successful Docusaurus Build:** The generated book must compile and run locally without errors.
- **Successful GitHub Pages Deployment:** The final book must be successfully deployed and viewable online.
- **Completeness:** The book must fully explain and demonstrate the use of Spec-Kit Plus in the context of creating a Docusaurus site.
- **User Satisfaction:** The final guide is practical and enables a reader to create their own spec-driven book.
